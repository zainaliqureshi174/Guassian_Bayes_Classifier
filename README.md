# Guassian Bayes Classifier Implementation on the IRIS Dataset
Custom implementation of a Guassian Bayes Classifier on the IRIS dataset using NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Includes data preprocessing, probabilistic calculations, and result visualizations. A practical demonstration of Guassian Bayes statistics for classification tasks in machine learning.
This repository contains a custom implementation of a Guassian Bayes Classifier from scratch. The project leverages Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to classify the IRIS dataset into its respective categories.

This implementation demonstrates the principles of probabilistic classification using Bayes' theorem and provides insightful visualizations to support the learning process.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the IRIS dataset using Pandas.
Guassian Bayes Classifier: Implemented from scratch using NumPy and SciPy for efficient computations.
Visualizations: Data distribution and classification results plotted using Matplotlib.
Model Evaluation: Accurate classification of the IRIS dataset based on probabilistic analysis.

# Requirements
To run this project, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

numpy
scipy
pandas
matplotlib
Install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib

# Dataset
The IRIS dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

# Output
Predictions: Classification of IRIS samples into their respective species.
Accuracy: Evaluation of the classifier's performance.
Visualizations: Graphical representation of feature distributions and classification results.
